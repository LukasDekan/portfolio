        <h1>Thanksgiving website</h1>

        <p>The most colorful time of year is Autumn, a season where leaves peel off from the street, embroidered in different colors, all representing a monochromatic color scheme. This season of color is the leading inspiration behind my Thanksgiving-themed website, one of my favorite CART projects.

        <p>To create said site, I first made a mockup inside of Figma to get the general layout and Autumn-themed color scheme planned out. I then made CSS and HTML files inside of a GitHub repository, which I would use to code the website and make it functional. Throughout the process, I ran into the typical problems that any beginner web developer would come across, but with persistence, I managed to make a functioning website that serves its purpose and is aesthetically pleasing to look at. Once I finished, I hosted the project on Netlify for public visibility.

        <p>Although the site itself is limited in color, it still shares the warm feeling of Fall, which is achieved through its light, classy font styles and tasty-looking images of Thanksgiving food. The highlight for this website is the navigation menu, which adds to the fancy aesthetics along with being responsive and user-friendly. As with any CART project, I am proud of my work, and I am happy with the result.
