            <h2>The Blinding Torch Essay</h2>
            <p>In writing “The Blinding Torch,” I focused on stronger organization and clearer analysis, lessons I learned from past essays. I made sure each paragraph supported my thesis and flowed logically.
            </p>
            <p>I applied teacher and peer feedback by using more direct quotes and cutting unnecessary repetition. The final result was a focused, thoughtful essay that deepened my understanding of literary analysis.

            <h2>War of Finance Essay
            </h2>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>This essay was based on a passage from Middlemarch by George Eliot, highlighting a married couple’s financial conflict. The first draft lacked structure and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>After receiving teacher notes, I rewrote the essay to better organize my points and emphasize theme over summary. I made sure each paragraph had a clear purpose and stronger evidence.
            </p>
            <p>Through revision, I learned to be more concise and analytical. The final version is more refined and thoughtful, showing how feedback and revision are essential to improving my writing.
