        <p>For my Landscape Painting project in Art 2, I knew right away that I wanted to create a beautiful, vibrant green landscape. I’ve always been drawn to lush, natural scenes, and I wanted my painting to capture that sense of life and peace.

        <p>As I searched for inspiration, I found a stunning reference photo of a castle perched on top of a rocky hill. The hill was surrounded by a dense forest, and in the distance, a towering mountain range stretched across the horizon behind the castle and trees. It was exactly the kind of dramatic, yet serene scene I had hoped to find.

        <p>Before starting the final piece, I spent time sketching out different layouts, experimenting with the placement of the castle, forest, and mountains to make sure the composition felt balanced and natural. I played with the scale and positioning until I found an arrangement that would guide the viewer’s eye naturally from the foreground to the background.

        <p>Once I was satisfied with the sketches, I moved on to the actual painting. I started with the sky and clouds, which turned out to be a much longer process than I expected. I carefully layered shades of blue and white, blending them to create soft, realistic clouds drifting across the sky.

        <p>After the sky was complete, I began working on the forest. I paid special attention to shading and layering different greens to give the forest a sense of depth and texture, letting some areas fade into shadow while others caught the light. Next, I turned to the mountain range, using a mix of blues and grays to show the distance and atmosphere, softening the edges so they felt far away.

        <p>Finally, I painted the castle, giving it rich, detailed textures to make it stand out against the more organic background. I added highlights and shadows to the stone walls, making the structure feel ancient and sturdy against the wild landscape around it.

        <p>In the end, I was really proud of the final result. The painting captured the beauty and tranquility I had envisioned, and I felt that all the time spent layering, shading, and adjusting details had really paid off.
