    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my Personal Portfolio Website! My name is Lukas Dekan, and I am an aspiring game developer who strives to constantly improve his skills in different areas such as programming, concept art, level design and pixel art. In this website, you will find some of my favorite projects that I’ve completed over the years, as well as the process that I went through in order to complete them. I hope you enjoy my site as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My game development journey began in 2021, a time when I was a complete rookie. I had no clue what game design, concept art or programming actually felt like, but I knew that if I wanted to make functional games, I had to focus on the latter area of study. Thus, I started my adventure by delving into the vast world of coding, and my first step was to go on YouTube in search of a tutorial, one that could explain programming to beginners like me. This was when I discovered a video made by Brackeys, a channel that would later become one of my main sources of inspiration. The video not only served as an introduction to the world of programming, but it was also the beginning of a series of videos, all covering the basics of C#, which became my first coding language. Since then, I’ve completed many tutorials, worked with an amazing game engine, delved into the world of pixel art, started a concept art sketchbook, and so much more. </p>
