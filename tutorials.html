            <p>When I started my game development journey in 2021, the first thing I did was I went to YouTube in search of guidance. In a couple minutes, I found a tutorial series that covered the basics of programming in C#, and once I completed it, I had some of the most essential coding tools under my belt.

            <p>Since then, I have completed other tutorials and discovered amazing applications used for both programming and game development alike. Some of those apps included VS Code, GitHub, and, of course, the Unity game engine. I used these applications in other tutorial series, such as the “Make a game in Unity” tutorial series done by Brackeys, and the “Retro FPS” tutorial done by GamesplusJames.

            <p>My interest in development eventually led me to attend The Center of Advanced Research and Technology (CART), where I expanded my knowledge by learning CSS and HTML—the foundational building blocks of any website—and was introduced to a new programming language: JavaScript.
