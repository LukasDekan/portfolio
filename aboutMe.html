            <p>Born in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and having moved to the United States in 2022, I’ve experienced a unique blend of cultures that has shaped both my academic and personal growth. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been fortunate to receive several awards and recognitions that reflect my dedication to learning. I was named Student of the Year in 2016 at Kharkiv Private School “The Beginning of Wisdom” during 3rd grade. I also earned 1st place three times in the “Greenwich” English Language Contest (2015–2016, 2018) in Kharkiv, Ukraine, and later placed 2nd and 3rd in English language city/district competitions in 7th and 9th grade.</p>

            <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy spending my free time sketching in my sketchbook, practicing programming, working on game development projects, and going to the gym to stay active. Looking ahead, I plan to attend Clovis Community College and eventually transfer to a four-year university to pursue a bachelor’s degree in computer science.</p>
